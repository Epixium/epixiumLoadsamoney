hey! this project was made by Epixium (@epixium on discord, youtube, bsky, basically look up Epixium hard enough and i might be there)
made this public because i'm sure as hell not updating it, so you can toy around with it if you so choose.
feel free to make any (non-commercial) edits you want AS LONG AS you credit me in an obvious place

now Go, my son. Be free.
